# Anchor
### *Manifesting Intent through Intelligence.*

Anchor is the premier interface for modern intentionality—a mobile platform that transmutes abstract goals into tangible, AI-generated visual sigils. By fusing the ancient psychology of symbolism with the precision of generative AI, Anchor allows users to not just set goals, but to **embed them** into their daily subconscious through ritualistic activation and high-fidelity visualizers.

## 🚧 Project Status: Active Development
Anchor is currently undergoing rapid iteration. We are establishing the foundational architecture and core generative pipelines. The application is being built with a "quality-first" ethos, prioritizing fluid animations (via Reanimated & Skia), robust type safety, and a secure, scalable backend.

**Current Focus:** Implementation of the Sigil Generation Engine and refinement of the "Activation" user flows.

## Key Features & Value Proposition

- **🧠 AI-Driven Sigil Synthesis**  
  Leveraging **Stable Diffusion XL**, Anchor analyzes user intentions (e.g., "Find inner peace," "Launch my startup") and distills them into unique, abstract visual symbols. These aren't just images; they are psychological anchors designed to trigger subconscious alignment.

- **⚡ Daily Activation Rituals**  
  A gamified, commitment-based system where users "charge" their anchors daily. Using **haptic feedback** and **gestural interactions**, users physically reinforce their commitment to their goals.

- **🎨 Premium Aesthetic Engine**  
  Built with **React Native Skia** and **Reanimated**, the UI features glassmorphism, fluid gradients, and physics-based interactions that feel alive. The interface is designed to be a sanctuary—distraction-free and deeply immersive.

- **🛡️ The Vault**  
  A secure, encrypted repository for your most private ambitions. Your intentions are stored with the highest privacy standards, ensuring your personal growth journey remains yours alone.
